# Lines of Work — Documentation

## What Is This?

`lines-of-work` is a Python library of agent definitions, each covering a cohesive set of related duties within a distinctively named entity — the front desk at a fantasy hotel, the engineering team at a boutique studio, the admissions office at a named university. Each *work* ships with two resources:

- **Agent** — a persona prompt scoped to a functional role area within one named entity, ready to plug into any LLM-powered agent framework.
- **Knowledge base** — a curated set of topical entries covering the domain expertise required to carry out those duties.

The library is organized as a three-level taxonomy:

```text
Industry  →  Subcategory  →  Work
```

All 19 industries and their subcategories are available out of the box. Work modules are added incrementally.

---

## Taxonomy

The full taxonomy is discoverable at runtime:

```python
import lines_of_work as low

industries    = low.list_industry_ids()
subcategories = low.list_subcategory_ids(low.IndustryID("finance_insurance"))
works         = low.list_work_ids(
    low.IndustryID("finance_insurance"),
    low.SubcategoryID("banking"),
)
```

Each call returns a plain list of typed string IDs (`IndustryID`, `SubcategoryID`, `WorkID`). No work modules are loaded until you explicitly construct a `Work`.

---

## Loading a Work

```python
work = low.Work(
    low.IndustryID("healthcare_social_work"),
    low.SubcategoryID("clinic_medical_services"),
    low.WorkID("silver_lotus_clinic_triage"),
)

# Agent
print(work.agent.name)          # "Silver Lotus Clinic — Triage"
print(work.agent.description)   # what entity + what duty
print(work.agent.instructions)  # persona prompt scoped to these duties (up to 2048 tokens)

# Knowledge
for kid in work.list_knowledge_ids():
    entry = work.get_knowledge(kid)
    print(entry.title)
    print(entry.content)
```

`Work` loads `agent.py` eagerly on construction. Knowledge items are loaded on demand via `get_knowledge`.

## Data Models

### `Agent`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `str` | `"<Entity> — <Duty>"` (e.g. `"Fantasy Moon Hotel — Concierge"`). |
| `description` | `str` | What entity this belongs to and what specific duty this agent covers. |
| `instructions` | `str` | Persona prompt scoped to a functional role area within this entity. Up to 2048 tokens. |
| `language` | `str` | BCP 47 code for the agent's default operating language. Default `"en"`. |
| `version` | `str` | Semantic version, default `"0.0.1"`. |

### `Knowledge`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `str` | Short topic heading. |
| `content` | `str` | Substantive text on the topic. 128–1024 tokens per item. |
| `version` | `str` | Semantic version, default `"0.0.1"`. |

### `Industry` / `Subcategory`

Both are Pydantic models with `id`, `name`, and `description` fields. `Industry` also carries a `subcategories: list[Subcategory]`. They can be populated by importing an industry or subcategory module directly:

```python
import importlib

ind = importlib.import_module("lines_of_work.industries.education")
print(ind.name)        # "Education"
print(ind.description)
```
